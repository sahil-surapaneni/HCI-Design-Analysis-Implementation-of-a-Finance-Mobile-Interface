## (Part 1) Cultural Probes
The goal of this part is to practice the use of cultural probes to understand 
user needs, problems, frustrations, breakdowns, and workarounds in the context in 
which these events happen. Cultural probes allow us to 
capture data on people’s day-to-day experiences as they take place in their natural 
contexts. This method will be particularly useful in understanding users’ experiences 
around mobile computing as other methods such as contextual inquiry is not feasible 
due to the temporal and spatial spontaneity of these experiences—as the name 
suggests, users are “mobile” when they use mobile interfaces and we simply can’t 
follow them around. 

The goal of the cultural probe is to uncover the needs that your users might have 
for  different  kinds  of  information,  communication,  enabling  technologies,  etc.  in  the 
context of mobile computing. 

Creating a Cultural Probe contains 4 main section, **Identifying Users** (Determine who the potential users are (e.g., college students), **Preparing the Probe** (Determining what we are trying to understand given the problem setting and the kind of data we want to collect), **Present, probe, collect** (Presented my probe to the participants. Collected data for 5-7 days), **Analyze Data** (Collected all the data into an Excel spreadsheet. Analyzed the data 
using affinity and relationship diagrams.)

## (Part 2) Processbook
Collated all the information acquired from the cultural probes and used that to design Interfaces to solve the different problems uncovered with the Probes. Designed Low-Fidelity Prototypes of a potential solution using Adobe Figma. Iterated on multiple design versions using heuristic evaluations (Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics “Rule of Thumb”) and cognitive walkthrouhgs of the protoype until we settled on a final version. All the information is shown in **Final_Processbook.pdf** including the data & problems collected from the cultural proble, initial Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi desings, different design choices and prototype iterations.
